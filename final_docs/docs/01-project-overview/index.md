### Executive Summary

The Communication Platform is a unified backend system that solves the problem of fragmented multi-channel communication by integrating Telegram, Gmail, and Discord into a single microservices-based platform. It benefits business professionals, communication managers, and support teams who struggle with constant context switching between messaging apps. The solution provides a centralized API for message management across all platforms with AI-powered personalization using OpenAI, enabling efficient broadcast messaging and intelligent message adaptation based on recipient profiles. Key outcomes include 100+ messages per minute processing capacity, sub-500ms API response times, secure JWT authentication, and full GDPR compliance with encrypted credential storage.
